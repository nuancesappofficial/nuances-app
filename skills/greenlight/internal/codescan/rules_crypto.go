// cryptoComplianceRules returns the Guideline 3.1.5(b) checks for apps that
// handle cryptocurrency.
//
// These flag *process* obligations a code scan can detect the need for but not
// verify: a crypto wallet app must be offered by a developer enrolled as an
// organization, and an app that facilitates exchange or transmission of crypto
// must be offered by the exchange itself. App Review commonly follows up (in the
// Resolution Center) asking for licensing evidence or a legal opinion, so
// surfacing the requirement before submission is the point.
//
// Calibration matters because HIGH findings fail `preflight --exit-code`:
//   - crypto-exchange-sdk is HIGH, but only fires on a real provider-SDK package
//     identifier (scoped or -suffixed), so a bare word like "sardine" in a
//     non-crypto app can't trip CI.
//   - crypto-wallet-org-account and crypto-exchange-signals are WARN — weaker
//     wallet-SDK and copy/phrase heuristics that inform without gating.
//   - crypto-exchange-brand is WARN — a reference to a known exchange/wallet
//     brand (by domain or SDK), which may only mean the app links out.
//
// All four are firstMatchOnly (a crypto app is a project-level fact) and carry
// no antiPatterns, since the obligation can't be discharged in source. Silence a
// finding on a code line with `// greenlight:ignore <rule-id>`, or — because the
// SDK rules fire on package.json, where a comment can't live — disable/downgrade
// it in .greenlight.yml (`rules: { <rule-id>: { enabled: false } }`).
